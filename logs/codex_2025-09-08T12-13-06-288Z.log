**Implementing TypeScript utility**

I need to create a TypeScript utility function for optimizing budgets in an EU project. First, I should check the repository's structure and existing patterns. Running ripgrep will help list the files and check for any relevant tests or build steps. Since I have full access to the repo, I’ll also need to follow the AGENTS.md specifications if they're there. Let’s start exploring the files to get a sense of everything.

I’m going to scan the repo to understand structure, coding patterns, and where a budget optimization utility should live, then implement it with Zod validation and tests.

**Considering project optimization**

Great, I've installed Zod! This project is using Zod within MCC types. Now, I'll need to add a utility for "EU project budget optimization" with proper validation and error handling. It seems this utility will work by taking budgets from different projects and providing optimized allocation suggestions. I see we already have a masterControl/projectRegistry with the necessary budget information, so let’s inspect that to make sure the types align correctly.

**Planning the budget optimizer**

I need to create a utility function that optimizes budgets based on project data. This function should accept an array of projects and return allocation recommendations while sticking to constraints like currency, risk, priority, and timeline. The request also involves validating inputs and outputs using Zod, so I'll set up the appropriate schema. I’ll create a new file budgetOptimizer.ts in src/utils and ensure there’s error handling with logging that includes emojis. Lastly, I'll check for tests under src/tests and see how they’re organized.

I need to figure out how tests work here. They should utilize basic functions and can be run with either ts-node or ts-node/register.

**Creating budget optimizer utility**

I’m setting up a new utility file for the budget optimizer. It seems like we should integrate with the analytics or optimization engine since it’s all about cost optimization. But specifically, I’ll focus on the EU project budget. I’m creating `src/utils/budgetOptimizer.ts` and will use Zod schema for inputs, which will include an array of ProjectBudget entries. These will have fields like id, name, priority, risk, allocated, spent, currency, and timeline. We'll also need to ensure currencies are uniform or handled properly.
**Adding budget optimization functions**

I’ll provide additional functions for optimizing budget allocation, specifically `optimizeBudgetAllocation`, which will return an AllocationPlan along with recommended adjustments and warnings. I’ll set up a Zod schema to validate the input structure. There will also be a custom error class, `BudgetOptimizationError`, which I'll guard using try/catch and log appropriately, following a specific style like in `countryCodes.ts`. 

The implementation will involve computing project scores based on priority, risk, and available budget, while proposing to redistribute flexible budget from lower priority projects. We'll add constraints like a total reallocation limit percentage and a minimum reserve per project.
**Defining optional constraints**

I’m going to define some optional constraints for the budget optimizer. First, there’s `maxReallocationPercent`, which defaults to 20% of the total allocated budget for reallocation, and `minProjectReservePercent`, set at 10%. I’ll also need an array, `lockProjects`, for project IDs that shouldn’t change, plus a `targetCurrency`, defaulting to EUR and ensuring errors with mixed currencies unless `allowMixedCurrency` is true. 

I plan to implement minimal code for defining schemas like ProjectInputSchema and ConstraintsSchema. Validating input with Zod will be key, and I’ll establish scoring based on priority and risk weights, with a focus on allocating to medium or low-risk projects. I'll make sure to provide configuration for a these settings.
**Setting scoring and reallocation metrics**

For the budget optimizer, I'm setting priority weights where P0 is 1.5, P1 is 1.2, P2 is 1.0, and P3 is 0.8. I'll also implement risk penalties: low at 1.0, medium at 0.9, high at 0.8, and critical at 0.7. To factor in urgency, I'll compute the days remaining factor too.

Next, I’ll define "need" based on the target and allocated budgets, and calculate "runway shortfall" as well as "room for capital." The reallocation pool will come from unlocked donor projects, ensuring we maximize the budget for those in need while minimizing overspending.
**Finalizing donation and adjustment processes**

I’m going to sum the donor budgets and cap them by the maxReallocationPercent multiplied by the total allocated amount. From there, I’ll distribute funds to recipients based on their scores, focusing on those lacking a buffer defined by their target. If a target is missing, I'll skip the need calculation, instead prioritizing runway index, which takes into account the buffer, days remaining, and daily burn rate.

I’ll handle edge cases, such as throwing an error for no projects, managing invalid dates, and preventing division by zero. The output will include adjustments for each project, a summary of total reallocation, and any warnings. I’ll also create tests with sample projects to validate the function’s logic and export schemas for reuse while following TypeScript module style.
